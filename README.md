# Poznavacka is a simple program for learning names of plants or animals and theirs taxonomy

Currently program is set for czech language so if you plan to use it you will need to uncomment some lines.
Also I have setup my initial directory, which is absolute path so that needs to be rewritten to.

Program loads pictures from directory, and each picture has to follow same naming scheme.

e.g. houba pletená (KM.živočišné houby,houbovci;TR.křemičití) 2.jpg

name_of_organism (taxonomy) number_of_picure.jpg/png

taxonomy is written in in form CATEGORY_ABBREVIATION.name_of_category_for_specific_organims;SUBCATEGORY_ABBREVIATION etc.
I might add some more examples to naming scheme.
